# CS-370
**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
**  
In this course, we mainly focused on AI and the several methods of machine learning. We used methods like reinforcement learning. We also looked into differences in approaches to AIs like AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero. AI right no in computer science is booming, this subject is not only relevant to computer science, it is the new computer science. Since I started at SNHU almost 3 years ago, AI has come so far that to me the rate at which AI is evolving and progessing, in the next 3 years I feel like AI will be 10 times more used and more effective. 

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**
  Computer Scientists perform hypothesis, experiment, and analyze new technology every day. They are always trying to create something better or build on something current to make it better. They are always trying to further expand the world and possibiliies of computer science.  

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
**
  I think the best way to approach a problem in CS is being able to define what the problem is, defining the scale of the problem, the scope, and being able to identify what is potentially needed of what system isneeded to solve said problem. I personally have always found that who, what, and why is always a good starting point for me. Who am I fixing this problem for, what problem am I fixing, and why am I fixing this problem? 

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
**
  My personal ethical responsibility as a CS is never to do harm. Never create or work on anything that can lead to any sort of personal gain or harm to others. I also believe that being honest and having deep personal integrity is also very important.
